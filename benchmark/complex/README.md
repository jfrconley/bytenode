Benchmark usage with a large, bundled application and compares results to baseline.
Key metrics are bytecode size and startup time.
This should give a representative idea of how performance of larger applications is effected.

Application generated by running esbuild on the express application example in this repository.
`esbuild --platform=node --minify --format=cjs --bundle --outfile=test.js server.js`

Startup performance is measured using hyperfine (manually installed in path).
